## About the Developer

**Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Steven!**

I'm currently pursuing my Master's degree in Physics at Tomsk State University, specializing in Theoretical and Practical Astronomy. My academic journey has deepened my understanding of the cosmos and fueled my passion for unraveling the mysteries of orbital mechanics.

Besides my love for physics and astronomy, I'm also an enthusiastic iOS developer. I enjoy merging scientific inquiry with modern technology to create tools that simplify complex concepts.

I developed this app to help you understand two-body problem algorithms. With this tool, you can:
- Calculate Earth's satellite initial coordinates and velocity vectors from a given set of orbital parameters
- Derive orbital parameters from a set of initial coordinates and velocity vectors

I hope this app inspires you to explore the fascinating world of space science and technology.

**Design Credits:** This app is designed by **Muhammad Rafi Hayla Arifa**.
